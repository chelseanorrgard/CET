1. **Project Overview**:

- Project Name: Hotel Room Reservation Application
- Project Manager: Chelsea Norrgård, <e2202776@edu.vamk.fi>
- Project Sponsor: VAMK
- Project Description: The Hotel Room Reservation Application is a web-based system designed to streamline hotel operations by providing dedicated views for administrators, customers, and receptionists. It enables efficient room management, improves the customer experience, and automates the reservation process.
- Scope Statement: The project will include designing, developing, testing, and deploying the application using JavaScript and MongoDB. It will focus on providing core functionality to support hotel room reservations, customer account management, and staff operations.

2. **Scope:**

- Items in Scope:
  - Development of three distinct user views: Administrator, Customer, and Receptionist.
  - Implementation of core features: room search, booking management, and user account control.
  - Integration with a backend database using MongoDB for data storage.
  - Secure handling of user data and role-based access control.
- Items Outside of Scope:
  - Payment gateway integration.
  - Advanced analytics and reporting functionalities.
  - Mobile application development.
- Assumptions and Constraints:
  - Project must adhere to specified budget and timeline.
  - Limited development team and resources.
  - Compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR.

3. **Project Objectives:**

- Objectives:
- Develop a user-friendly, web-based reservation system.
- Provide secure and efficient management of customer data.
- Enable administrators to manage rooms, view bookings, and handle user roles.
- Ensure the system can support future scaling as the business grows.
- Key Success Criteria:
- All essential features are implemented and tested.
- Positive feedback from initial users (customers, administrators, and receptionists).
- Compliance with security and data protection standards.
- Project completion within the specified timeframe and budget.
- Major Functions
- Administrator Functions:
- Manage room data and reservations.
- Assign roles and control access.
- Customer Functions:
- Search and view available rooms.
- Make and manage reservations.
- Receptionist Functions:
- View and update room statuses.
- Check-in and check-out management.
- Performance Issues
- Response Time: The application should respond within 2-3 seconds for standard queries.
- Data Integrity: Ensuring accurate and consistent data across all user views.
- Security: Implementing role-based access control and secure handling of customer information.
- Scalability: The application should support growth in terms of room capacity and user base.
- Management and Technical Constraints
- Technology: Use of JavaScript and MongoDB.
- Timeline: The project must be completed by 05/12/2024.
- Budget: Limited financial resources.

4. **Project Estimates:**

- Historical Data:
  - Expected time spent on:
  - Requirements gathering (3 days)
  - Design and Prototyping (1 weeks)
  - Development and Coding (3-4 weeks)
  - Testing and Quality Assurance (1 week)
  - Deployment and User Training (1 weeks)
- Average costs for similar projects, focusing on:
  - Development hours or cost per hour for developers
  - Infrastructure and technology costs (e.g., MongoDB hosting, server costs)
  - Project management and overhead expenses
- Estimation Techniques:
  - For this project, the following techniques would be suitable:
  - Analogous Estimation: Using data from similar projects to estimate costs and timeframes for this project.
  - We estimate that this project will take 3 coders a total of 8 weeks to develop.
  - Expert Judgment: Consulting with experienced developers, project managers, or business analysts.
  - We estimate a moderate complexity for this project considering the planned use of JavaScript and MongoDB.
  - Three-Point Estimation: Using optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates to determine the expected duration and cost.
  - For the development module, we estimate 21 days (optimistic), 28 days (most likely), and 35 days (pessimistic), for an average of 28 days.
- Estimates:
  - Total Development Time: 8 weeks (~800 hours for each part-time developer)
  - Total Development Cost: 800 hours × 20€/hour = 16000€ per developer x 3 = 48000€
  - Project Management: 40 hours × 70€/hour = 2800€
  - Hosting and Infrastructure: 200€/month × 2 months = 400€
  - Total Estimated Cost: 51200€

5. **Project Risks:**

- Risk Identification:
- Delays due to technology limitations.
- Data breaches or security vulnerabilities.
- Scope creep from additional feature requests.
- Risk Assessment:
- Likelihood and impact of each risk will be evaluated.
- Risk Aversion Strategies:
- Implement regular code reviews and security testing.
- Prioritize features to avoid scope creep.
- Risk Monitoring Procedures:
- Weekly risk review meetings to assess current risks and mitigation strategies.
